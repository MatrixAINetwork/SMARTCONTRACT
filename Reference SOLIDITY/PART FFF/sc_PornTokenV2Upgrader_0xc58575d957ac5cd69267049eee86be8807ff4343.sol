/**
 * PornTokenV2 PT Upgrader on Ethereum Network: Ropsten Testnet
 * Converts PT to PTWO on a 4:1 reverse split basis
 *
 * The PT user transferring to PTWO must call
 * The approve(_address_of_this_contract, uint256 _value) function
 * from original token contract: 0x66497A283E0a007bA3974e837784C6AE323447de
 *
 * NOTE: _value must be expressed in the number of PT you want to convert + 18 zeros
 * to represent it's 18 decimal places.
 * So if you want to send 1 PT, do approve(_address_of_this_contract, 1000000000000000000)
 *
 * ...with the address of this Contract as the first argument
 * and the amount of PT to convert to PTWO as the 2nd argument
 *
 * Then they must call the ptToPtwo() method in this contract
 * and they will receive a 4:1 reverse split amount of PTWO
 * meaning 4 times less PTWO than PT
