/*
 * This is an example gambling contract that works without any ABI interface.
 * The entire game logic is invoked by calling the fallback function which
 * is triggered, e.g. upon receiving a transaction at the contract address
 * without any data sent along. The contract is attackable in a number of ways:
 * - as soon as someone paid in Ether and starts the game, register with a
 *   large number of addresses to spam the player list and most likely win.
 * - blockhash as source of entropy is attackable by miners
 * - probably further exploits
 * This only serves as a minimalistic example of how to gamble on Ethereum
