/*
    DonationForwarder v1.0
    
    When you're feeling generous, you can send ether to this contract to have
     it forwarded to someone else.
     
    You can buy or override a previous redirect by paying a higher price (note:
     there are NO refunds if your redirect is overriden!).
     
    You can purchase a redirect to your address by using the buyRedirect
     function (see the code).
     
    If you want the contract to forward ether to another address, use
     buyRedirectFor instead.
     
    Warning: the recommended gas limit for sending ether to this contract is
     at least 40000.
    
    The starting price is defined below.
