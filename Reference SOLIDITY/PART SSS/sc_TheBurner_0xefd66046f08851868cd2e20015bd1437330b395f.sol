/* The Burner v1.0, Main-Net release.
*  ~by Gluedog 
*  -----------
*
*  Compiler version: 0.4.19+commit.c4cbbb05.Emscripten.clang
*
* The Burner is Billionaire Token's version of a "Faucet" - an evil, twisted Faucet. 
* Just like a Faucet, people can use it to get some extra coins. 
* Unlike a Faucet, the Burner will also burn coins and reduce the maximum supply in the process of giving people extra coins.
* The Burner is only usable by addresses who have also participated in the last week's Raffle round.
