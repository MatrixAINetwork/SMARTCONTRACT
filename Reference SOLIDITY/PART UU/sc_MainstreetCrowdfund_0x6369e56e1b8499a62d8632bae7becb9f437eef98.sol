Mainstreet MITs Explanatory Language

Each Subscriber to the Fund will execute a subscription agreement and agree the
terms of a partnership agreement relating to the Fund. On acceptance of its
subscription by the Fund, execution of the partnership agreement and entry on
the Fund's limited partner records, a subscriber will become a Limited Partner
in the Fund.

Each Limited Partner will be issued with a certain number of Tokens by the Fund
in return for its subscription in the Fund.

Limited Partners, as part of the subscription process, will have provided to
the Fund all necessary due diligence and "know your client" information to
enable the Fund to discharge its regulatory obligations.

Although the Tokens issued to Limited Partners are operationally transferable,
either peer-to-peer or though a variety of Blockchain-enabled exchanges, it is
only the beneficial entitlement/ownership of the Tokens that is capable of being
transferred using such peer-to-peer networks or Blockchain exchanges.

It is only once a person is registered as a Limited Partner of the Fund that
such person becomes fully entitled to the rights associated with the Token and
the rights of a Limited Partner in the Fund.

If a Transferee wishes to perfect its legal ownership as a Limited Partner in
the Fund, the Transferee must register with the Fund, execute a subscription
agreement and/or such other documentation as the general partner of the Fund
shall require and provide all necessary "know your client" and due diligence
information that will permit the Fund to register the Transferee as a Limited
Partner in the Fund in substitution for the Transferor of the Tokens.

The registered Limited Partner to which such Token was originally issued remains
the legal holder of the Limited Partner interest in the Fund and retains the
entitlement to all distributions and profit realisation in respect of the Token. 
The arrangements governing the transfer of the Token from Transferor to
Transferee may oblige the Transferor to account for any such benefits to the
Transferee, but the Fund is only legally obliged to deal with the registered
Limited Partner of the Fund to which the relevant Tokens relate.

It is therefore incumbent on any Transferee/purchaser of Tokens to register with
the Fund as a Limited Partner as soon as possible.  Please contact the General
Partner to discuss the requirements to effect such registration.
