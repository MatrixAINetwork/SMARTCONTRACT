(“Project Token”) in furtherance of the establishment and operation of a B2B
marketplace for travel inventory called Winding Tree, as described in the White
Paper.
Please note that the agreement below only concerns the pre-sale token allocation
and not the the Token Distribution Event, which will have its own rules,
described in Exhibit A.

White Paper: the technical document drafted and published by Company explaining
the Project and its components, including the Project Plan and technical
characteristics of the Project. Attached hereto as Exhibit C.
Purchase, Sale and Distribution of Tokens
On the Token Distribution Event, Company shall deliver to Buyer a number of
Project Tokens calculated by the following formula:
x=Pt∗(1+b)
where “x” is the number of tokens that the Buyer will receive after the Token
Distribution Event, “P” is Purchase Price, “t” is Token Price (determined at the
end of the Token Distribution Event) and “b” is Bonus Rate (e.g. 0.1 for 10%).
Example: 100 ETH / 1 ETH * (1 + 0.1) = 110 tokens.
Usage License
Ownership of Project Tokens carries no rights, whether express or implied, other
than a limited right (license) to use the Project Token Protocol, if and to the
extent the Project Token Protocol has been successfully completed and launched.
In particular, Buyer understands and accepts that Project Tokens do not
represent or constitute any ownership right or stake, share or security or
equivalent rights nor any right to receive future revenues, shares or any other
form of participation or governance right in or relating to the Project Token
Protocol and/or the Project Tokens.
By transferring ETH to Company and/or receiving Project Tokens, no form of
partnership, joint venture or any similar relationship between the Buyer and
Company is created.
Risks
The Buyer understands and accepts the risks in connection with making a
Contribution to Company and creating Project Tokens. In particular, but not
concluding, the Buyer understands the inherent risks listed hereinafter as
well as in the Contribution Terms, which will be handed over to Buyer:
Risk of software weaknesses: The Buyer understands and accepts that the Smart
Contract System concept, the underlying software application and software
platform (i.e. the Ethereum blockchain) is still in an early development stage
and unproven, why there is no warranty that the process for creating Project
Tokens will be uninterrupted or error-free and why there is an inherent risk
that the software could contain weaknesses, vulnerabilities or bugs causing,
inter alia, the complete loss of ETH and/or Project Tokens.
Regulatory risk: The Buyer understands and accepts that the blockchain
technology allows new forms of interaction and that it is possible that certain
jurisdictions will apply existing regulations on, or introduce new regulations
addressing, blockchain technology based applications, which may be contrary to
the current setup of the Smart Contract System and which may, inter alia, result
in substantial modifications of the Smart Contract System and/or the Project
Token Protocol, including its termination and the loss of Project Tokens for the
Buyer.
Risk of abandonment / lack of success: The Buyer understands and accepts that
the creation of the Project Tokens and the development of the Project Token
Protocol may be abandoned for a number of reasons, including lack of interest
from the public, lack of funding, lack of commercial success or prospects (e.g.
caused by competing projects). The Buyer therefore understands that there is no
assurance that, even if the Project Token Protocol is partially or fully
developed and launched, the Buyer will receive any benefits through the Project
Tokens held by him.
Risk of withdrawing partners: The Buyer understands and accepts that the TGE and
the feasibility of the Project as a whole depends strongly on the collaboration
of banks and other crucial partners of Company. The Buyer therefore understands
that there is no assurance that TGE will take place as foreseen or the Project
as a whole will be successfully executed.
Risk associated with other applications: The Buyer understands and accepts that
the Project Token Protocol may give rise to other, alternative projects,
promoted by unaffiliated third parties, under which Project Tokens will have no
intrinsic value.
Risk of loss of private key: Project Tokens can only be accessed by using an
Ethereum Wallet with a combination of Buyer’s account information (address),
private key and password. The private key is encrypted with a password. The
Buyer understands and accepts that if his private key file or password
respectively got lost or stolen, the obtained Project Tokens associated with the
Buyer's account (address) or password will be unrecoverable and will be
permanently lost.
Risk of theft: The Buyer understands and accepts that the Smart Contract System
concept, the underlying software application and software platform (i.e. the
Ethereum blockchain) may be exposed to attacks by hackers or other individuals
that could result in theft or loss of Project Tokens or ETH.
Risk of Ethereum mining attacks: The Buyer understands and accepts that, as with
other cryptocurrencies, the blockchain used for the Smart Contract System is
susceptible to mining attacks, including but not limited to double-spend
attacks, majority mining power attacks, “selfish-mining” attacks, and race
condition attacks. Any successful attacks present a risk to the Smart Contract
System, expected proper execution and sequencing of Project Token transactions,
and expected proper execution and sequencing of contract computations.
Token Liquidity. Buyer understands that with regard to Project Tokens no market
liquidity may be guaranteed and that the value (if any) of Project Tokens over
time may experience extreme volatility or depreciate resulting in full and total
loss that will be borne exclusively by Buyer with respect to the Project Tokens
Buyer purchases under this Agreement.
Risk of incompatible Wallet service: The Buyer understands and accepts, that the
Wallet or Wallet service provider used for the contribution, has to be
technically compatible with the Project Token. The failure to assure this may
have the result that Buyer will not gain access to his Project Token.
Limited Warranties. Except as otherwise set forth herein, in the White Paper,
Token Characteristics Document, and/or the Token Distribution Plan, Buyer
understands and expressly accepts that there is no warranty whatsoever of the
Project Token and/or the success of the Project, expressed or implied, to the
extent permitted by law, and that Project Tokens will be created and delivered
to Buyer at the sole risk of Buyer on an “as is” and “under development” basis
and without, to the extent permitted by law, any warranties of any kind,
including, but not limited to, express or implied warranties of merchantability
or fitness for a particular purpose.
Limitations on Recovery. Buyer understands that Buyer has no right against any
Company or any other Person to request any refund or redemption of the Purchase
Price except as otherwise provided herein and/or as a result of, or in
connection with, Company’s breach of this Agreement, negligence or willful
misconduct.
