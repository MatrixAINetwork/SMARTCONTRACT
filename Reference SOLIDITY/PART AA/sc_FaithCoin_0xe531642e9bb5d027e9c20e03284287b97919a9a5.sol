   Take hold of the eternal life to which you were called 
   when you made your good confession in the presence of many witnesses."

   even as your soul is getting along well."
 
   Verse about Family
   
   Genesis 28:14
   "Your offspring shall be like the dust of the earth,

   and in you and your offspring shall all the families of the earth be blessed."

   

   Verse About Friends

   God will Protect you

   they will not sweep over you. When you walk through the fire, you will not be burned; 
   the flames will not set you ablaze."

   

   Trust in our GOD
   
   Proverbs 3:5-6

   and he will make your paths straight."
